The code has been created and includes configurations for:

ADC with DMA: Reads analog values and converts them to digital.
Timer: Triggers ADC conversions periodically.
PWM: Controls a PWM output (e.g., for a fan or LED brightness) based on the ADC value.
UART: Sends the ADC results as interpreted data (e.g., temperature) to a terminal or monitoring system.
Please set up the hardware accordingly:

ADC Pin (PA0): Connect it to a voltage source varying between 0 and 3.3V.
PWM Output Pin (TIM3_CH1): Connect it to an LED or other PWM-driven device.
UART TX (PA2): Connect to a serial-to-USB adapter to view output on a terminal application.
Power and ground appropriately for the STM32F407 microcontroller.
